# Symfony Docker

## Getting Started

1. If not already done, [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.10+)
2. Run `docker compose build --no-cache` to build fresh images
3. Run `docker compose up --pull always -d --wait` to set up and start a fresh Symfony project
4. Open https://localhost in your web browser and [accept the auto-generated TLS certificate](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15076602/1352334)
5. Import the logs with executing `docker compose exec php bin/console app:process_logs`. This will import all records from the sample log file.
